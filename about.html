            <p class="text-white"> In June of 1998, a young entrepreneur by the name of Shanile Shakoor​ established Nile Style Barbershop with the hopes of creating the best barbershop ever. Nile Style has apprenticed and obtained licenses for numerous barbers currently operating in Baltimore City.</p>
            
            <p>Monthly Conversation Parties were held here for seven straight years to provide a platform for men to share ideas, learn how to handle conflict, and most of all, be better men. Nile Style has hosted back-to-school events, provided free haircuts for non-profit organizations, hosted Morgan State University Homecoming events and other music events, created a book scholarship for business students attending Morgan State University, and partnered with numerous organizations.</p>

            <p> This all manifested from an idea that was created in the mind of a fifteen year old kid from Jersey City with the audacity to dream.</p>


            <p>Nile Style is a modern barbershop with an old school vibe. Since 1998 we have served the community with a family-friendly and professional atmosphere. Nile Style Barbershop serves men, women, and children. We accept appointments and walk-ins. Come in and enjoy free wi-fi, flat screen TV's, mellow music, and a friendly atmosphere.</p>
