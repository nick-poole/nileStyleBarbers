            <p>
                In June of 1998, a young entrepreneur by the name of Shanile Shakoorâ€‹ established Nile Style Barbershop with the hopes of creating the best barbershop ever. Nile Style has apprenticed and obtained licenses for numerous barbers currently operating in Baltimore City.

                Monthly Conversation Parties were held here for seven straight years to provide a platform for men to share ideas, learn how to handle conflict, and most of all, be better men. Nile Style has hosted back-to-school events, provided free haircuts for non-profit organizations, hosted Morgan State University Homecoming events and other music events, created a book scholarship for business students attending Morgan State University, and partnered with numerous organizations.

                This all manifested from an idea that was created in the mind of a fifteen year old kid from Jersey City with the audacity to dream.
